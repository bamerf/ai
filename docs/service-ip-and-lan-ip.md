## Services IP

The services IP is a network address used by the Virtual Hardware manager. Virtual services such as serial port (console) pass-through or vMMIO use it. The service IP is used by the Virtual Hardware infrastructure.

## LAN IP

The LAN IP is a network address used by programs running inside the Virtual Hardware. For instance, if a web server or SSH server is running on the virtual device, it will use the LAN IP.

Both can be found on either the "CONNECT" or "SETTINGS" menus of a device.
