Corellium has a strict vetting process to ensure that our platform is exclusively used for legitimate and lawful purposes. Individuals, organizations, and people in countries that are sanctioned by the US government are not eligible to sign-up for Corellium. Additionally, we have never sold any devices or services to clients that are known or suspected of developing tools used in hacking campaigns against ordinary citizens, journalists, or activists, and will never do so.
