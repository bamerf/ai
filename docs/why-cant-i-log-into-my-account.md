You may find yourself seemingly locked out, or questioning if you're using the right Username & Password. More often
than not, it's as simple as using the wrong domain.

Ensure that you’re utilizing the correct domain login, I.e. Individual vs Enterprise.

## Individual Cloud Customer Domain

Use the following URL: [https://app.corellium.com/login](https://app.corellium.com/login)

## Enterprise Cloud Customer Domain
Determine your enterprise domain then access the URL in the following format: [https://your_enterprise_domain.enterprise.corellium.com/login](https://your_enterprise_domain.enterprise.corellium.com/login).
