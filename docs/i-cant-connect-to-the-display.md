If your browser doesn't support H.264, you will not be able to view the device display. Certain browsers, such as [Chromium](https://superuser.com/questions/1541739/h-264-video-support-in-chromium-missing-codec), do not support H.264 and are not supported for using Corellium. For an optimal experience, please ensure you are using the latest version of Safari, Chrome, or Firefox.

Additionally, certain firewall settings can prevent the display from connecting properly, resulting in a black screen. If you are using an enterprise network, your network administrator may be able to assist in troubleshooting these network settings. In most cases, a firewall setting will be blocking a particular port or range of ports that are required for our display server.
