Navigate, search and manage your deviceâ€™s filesystem.

## Navigate the filesystem

Corellium gives you control over the device filesystem, allowing you to upload, download, delete, modify and search for files.

## Inspect files in detail

The file system is displayed in a standard hierarchy reflecting the file system on the device and displays the file or folder name, size, permissions, and more.

## Modify file permissions

Modifying a file enables you to change the file or folder name, GID, UID, and Protection level. If the pen icon with a slash through it is displayed instead of the Upload button, you are in a read-only directory (not permitted to be modified).
