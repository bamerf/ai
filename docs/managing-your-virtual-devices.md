## The Devices Screen

When you log in, you will land on your **Devices** homepage. This is where you can check the status of your devices, turn devices on or off, delete devices, and create new devices. You can always return to this page by clicking "Devices" in the top navigation bar, or the Corellium logo.

One of the most important elements on this page is the indicator showing how many unused (available) device slots you have. Since you have an unused device slot, you can create one device at this time. Go ahead and click Create Device.

_Note: if you're an Enterprise Account user, you may see devices organized into multiple **projects**. Projects allow administrators to manage device resources. Each project is assigned a certain number of **CPU cores**, and different device models require a different number of CPU cores. You'll need at least two available CPU cores to create a device._

## Device States

Active devices are devices in the On state. They occupy both CPU cores and storage. When you turn a device Off, it becomes Stored. It will still occupy storage, but no longer occupy CPU cores. Monthly subscriptions provide a specified number of active device slots, and for each active device slot, you get 5 storage slots. Usage-based subscriptions are priced per hour per active device or per day per stored device.
